# Interactive Desktop Client Platform

**Project Type:** Desktop Interactive Web Client  
**Platform:** Desktop-first Web Application  
**Author:** Ahmad Reza Kordi 

## Overview
Windows Web Simulator is a creative frontend project that recreates a Windows-style desktop environment entirely in the browser.

This project was built to demonstrate **deep understanding of core frontend fundamentals**, including complex UI behavior, DOM manipulation, and event-driven logic — all without using any frameworks or libraries.

The focus is not visual realism for end users, but **engineering realistic UI interactions using pure JavaScript**.

## Why this project matters
Most junior frontend projects are static pages or basic CRUD apps.
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Design non-trivial UI systems
- Manage state manually
- Handle complex user interactions
- Build desktop-like UX patterns inside a browser

From a hiring perspective, this signals **problem-solving skills**, not tutorial-following.

## Features
- Desktop-style UI environment
- Window-based application system
- Custom drag & move logic for windows
- Program launcher (e.g. My Computer)
- Telegram UI mock (custom layout & interactions)
- Audio playback handling
- Event-driven behavior across the UI

---

## Technical Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- No frameworks or libraries

---

## Technical Highlights
- Custom drag implementation using mouse events
- Explicit DOM traversal and manipulation
- Modular JavaScript structure (logic separated by responsibility)
- Readable and maintainable code (not minified, not over-engineered)

## Responsiveness
This project is **desktop-only by design**.

The Windows UI metaphor is inherently desktop-focused.
Making it responsive would add artificial complexity without increasing the technical value of the project.
